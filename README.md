# Pytorch-model-for-verification-uing-ppg
In this project we trained Pytorch resnet model using our data set for biometric verification using ppg signals. 
At 1st we create csv file containing name of video and their subfolders. Then we created custom dataset using of our videos and provide the dataset to model for training and calculate acuracy of model.
#Flask Appliation
Then we create flask app containing resnet model and integrate it with our flutter application.
